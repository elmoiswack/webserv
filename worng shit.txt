curl -X PUT 127.0.0.1:8001 // check

- index can be any file 
- rules for location are separate 
- not responding to non implemented methods //check
- only 1 i/o per poll() // check
- exit() is not the smoothest way to handle an error 
- when cgi child exists with non zero value, seg fault 
- you dont respond to post without a boundary (curl localhost:8001 -X POST -H "Content-Type: plain/text" --data "BODY IS HERE write something shorter or longer than body limit")
