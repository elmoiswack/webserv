Hi,

Two days ago (03-03-2024), I was charging my electric car at a public charging spot in Den Haag. When I got back to the car, I found a note (see attachment) on the car window saying I have to pay the parking fine because I did not pay for the parking. I think there is a mistake because my car was parked correctly on the charging spot and it was charging.

Car number plate: B702RCI

Best regards,
Rares Anghel.



Hi,

I discovered a note (see attachment) on my car window claiming I got a parking fine. However, my electric vehicle with plate number B702RCI was charging at a designated spot for electric cars. Could there be an error?

Best regards,
Rares.
